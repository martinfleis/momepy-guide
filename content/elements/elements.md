Apart from morphometric analysis, momepy can generate certain kinds of morphological elements and link different elements together via unique_id (see [Data structure](../data_structure#links-between-elements)). The main feature of `elements` module is an algorithm generating **morphological tessellation** and consequent one generating blocks based on geometry of morphological tessellation.

This section covers:
* [Generating morphological tessellation](tessellation)
* [Generating tessellation-based blocks](blocks)
* [Linking morphological elements together](links)
