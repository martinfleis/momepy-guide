Momepy is a project allowing advanced quantitative analysis of urban form - urban morphometrics.
This toolkit aims to provide tools for the development of complex frameworks for a description of urban structures.

Reading this guide, you will learn:

* **[data structure](data_structure)** used in `momepy`,
* how to **[generate morphological elements](elements/elements)** like morphological tessellation and link them all together,
* how to calculate **[simple morphometric characters](simple/simple)**,
* how to calculate morphometric **[characters based on multiple sources](combined/combined)**,
* how to use **[spatial weights matrix](weights/weights)** with `momepy`, and
* how to do **[network analysis](graph/graph)**.
