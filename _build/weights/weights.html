<h1 id="Using-spatial-weights-matrix">Using spatial weights matrix<a class="anchor-link" href="#Using-spatial-weights-matrix"> </a></h1><p>To capture patterns in urban form, we have to analyze morphometric characters within a spatial context, taking into the account neighbouring elements. A simple example could be a mean height within 100 metres (measured as a location-based character for each building). <code>momepy</code> is using <code>libpysal</code> spatial weights to capture the relationship between elements, in this case, buildings, in the form of a binary matrix (1 = neighbours, 0 = not neighbours). Spatial weights are an essential part of <code>momepy</code> and are used on many occasions and in various forms. However, they should always be based on the unique ID of element, not index (there are a few exceptions documented in API).</p>
