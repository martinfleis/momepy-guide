<h1 id="Characters-based-on-multiple-GeoDataFrames">Characters based on multiple GeoDataFrames<a class="anchor-link" href="#Characters-based-on-multiple-GeoDataFrames"> </a></h1><p>One of the ways how to analyze urban patterns is to study relationships between different elements of urban form. <code>momepy</code> does exactly that. Following notebooks will show how to use <code>momepy</code> to measure characters of urban form based on two or more <code>GeoDataFrames</code>.</p>
