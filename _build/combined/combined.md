# Characters based on multiple GeoDataFrames

One of the ways how to analyze urban patterns is to study relationships between different elements of urban form. `momepy` does exactly that. Following notebooks will show how to use `momepy` to measure characters of urban form based on two or more `GeoDataFrames`.

This section covers:
* [Measuring spatial distribution](distribution)
* [Measuring density](intensity)
